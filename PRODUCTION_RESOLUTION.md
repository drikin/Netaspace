# Production Fix - Complete Solution

The issue is confirmed: PM2 shows the app as "online" but DATABASE_URL environment variable isn't loaded, causing startup crashes.

## Run These Commands to Fix

```bash
cd ~/Netaspace

# The ecosystem.config.js was already created, now apply it:
pm2 stop neta-app
pm2 delete neta-app
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save

# Wait for startup
sleep 10

# Verify fix
netstat -tlnp | grep :5000
curl http://localhost:5000/health
pm2 logs neta-app --lines 5
curl -I http://153.125.147.133
```

## Expected Results After Fix

- Port 5000 will show as listening
- Health check will return success
- PM2 logs will show database connection success
- External access will return website instead of 502

## Verification Commands

```bash
pm2 status
curl http://153.125.147.133
```

Your platform will be fully accessible once these commands complete.
